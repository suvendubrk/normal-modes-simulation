This assignment contains few graphs on Amplitude v/s n for particle 1 and particle 2 in a 10 mass system, which is saved as plt2.png and plt3.png respectively. ALso containing a graph between omega (nodal frequency) v/s node number, taking w0 (natural frequency) as 1. THe third one is a webpage named prog.html which simulates y(n,t) for varying N (number of particles) and n (node number). Do not tamper with the javascript file, and css file.
